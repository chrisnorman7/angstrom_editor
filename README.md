# Angstrom Editor

## Description

This editor provides a series of widgets which you can embed into your games to act as a level editor. In addition, the editor generates code according to various "events" you setup in room surfaces and objects, giving you a type safe way to combine Dart code with the results of a level editor.

For more information on Angstrom, see its [package page](https://pub.dev/packages/angstrom).

For a template which contains much of the boilerplate you'll need when creating a new game which ships this editor, see the [angstrom_editor_template](https://github.com/chrisnorman7/angstrom_editor_template) git repository.
